## Part I: San Francisco ðŸŒ‰

It is where everything begins

## Part II: Santa Cruz ðŸŒŠ

All my thoughts at that moment were flashing those lines from the end of **The Shawshank Redemption**.

> I find I am so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think itâ€™s the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.

I had also been dreaming of this moment for years, and now I was just a few feet away. So close, I could hear the waves crashing against the shore. So close, I could smell the salt hanging in the air. So close, I could almost taste the freedomâ€”an unfamiliar taste, yet one I had longed for all my life.
